/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------*

  Simply put, a data client is a type that accesses data, i.e., it is a
  client of the FleCSI data model. The core FleCSI library provides data
  structures, e.g., the mesh topology, that can be specialized to
  provide an interface for a particular class of applications. Data
  client instances must be registered with the FleCSI runtime so that
  initialization and memory management are handled correctly. When you
  call the registration interface for a data client, you are essentially
  just declaring a variable that will be accessible through the FleCSI
  interface later during program execution.

  For the purpose of this tutorial, we have created a specialization of
  the FleCSI mesh topology and defined the type mesh_t. This mesh type
  will be used for many of the examples in the tutorial. The methods
  exposed by mesh_t are intended only to give the reader a feel for the
  kinds of interfaces that can be defined using FleCSI. A real
  specialization may expose several different mesh types and other
  specializations, and would likely have a different interface.

  The registration interface for data clients takes the following
  arguments:

  (1) The data client type. This must be a valid specialization type. In
      general, application developers and end-users will not create this
      type directly. In this example, the data client type is "mesh_t".

  (2) The namespace of the data client instance that is being
      registered. Unlike task registration, this namespace does not have
      to be a valid C++ namespace. The namespace is intended to allow
      users to avoid naming collisions, i.e., internally, this argument will 
      will be used to distinguish data client instances with the same
      name from one another. In this example, the namespace is
      "clients".

  (3) The name of the client instance. This is the name of the variable
      that you would like to define. The name is arbitrary, and can be
      any legal C/C++ variable name. In this example, the name is
      "mesh".

  Below, the user should note the "ro" parameter that is used to define
  the mesh argument to the task. This parameter is specifying a privilege
  that tells the runtime what parts of the data might be modified during
  task execution. The concept of privileges will be covered in detail in
  a later example.
