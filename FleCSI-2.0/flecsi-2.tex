This is a citation \cite{LegeionSC12}.
In Figure \ref{fig:cycle}, we see some stuff

% Algorithm
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{algorithm}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \FOR{each edge in the input grid}
    \STATE create new instance
    \STATE set edge id
    \STATE set edge flags (\emph{boundary}, \emph{boundary type})
    \STATE request vertex pointer from the mesh using first vertex id
    \STATE add vertex to the edge
    \STATE request vertex pointer from the mesh using second vertex id
    \STATE add vertex to the edge
    \STATE add edge to the mesh
    \ENDFOR
  \end{algorithmic}
  \caption{Adding volume edges to the mesh.}
  \label{algo:volume_edge_assembly}
