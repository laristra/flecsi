CMake Configuration Options
===========================

The following set of options are available to control how FleCSI is
built.

* **BUILD_SHARED_LIBS [default: ON]** |br|
  Build shared library objects (as opposed to static).

* **CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE [default: Debug]** |br|
  Specify the build type (configuration) statically for this build tree.
  Possible choices are *Debug*, *Release*, *RelWithDebInfo*, and
  *MinSizeRel*.

* **CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX [default: /usr/local]** |br|
  Specify the installation path to use when *make install* is invoked.

* **CXX_CONFORMANCE_STANDARD [default: c++14]** |br|
  Specify to which C++ standard a compiler must conform. This is a
  developer option used to identify whether or not the selected C++
  compiler will be able to compile FleCSI, and which (if any) tests it
  fails to compile. This information can be shared with vendors to
  identify features that are required by FleCSI that are not
  standards-compliant in the vendor's compiler.

* **ENABLE_BOOST_PREPROCESSOR [default: ON]** |br|
  Boost.Preprocessor is a header-only Boost library that provides
  enhanced pre-processor options and manipulation, which are not
  supported by the standard C preprocessor. Currently, FleCSI uses the
  preprocessor to implement type reflection.

* **ENABLE_BOOST_PROGRAM_OPTIONS [default: OFF]** |br|
  Boost.Program\_options provides support for handling command-line
  options to a program. When this build option is enabled, CMake will
  attempt to locate a valid installation of the program options library,
  and Cinch will enable certain command-line options for unit tests. In
  particular, if Cinch's clog extensions are enabled, the *--tags*
  command-line option will be available to select output tags.

* **ENABLE_CINCH_DEVELOPMENT [default: OFF]** |br|
  If this option is enabled, extra information will be generated to help
  debug different Cinch behaviors. Currenlty, this only affects the
  generation of documentation: when enabled, the resulting PDF
  documentation will be annotated with the original locations of the
  content. **FIXME: We should consider renaming this option**

* **ENABLE_CINCH_VERBOSE [default: OFF]** |br|
  If this option is enabled, extra information will be output during the
  CMake configuration and build that may be helpful in debugging Cinch.

* **ENABLE_CLOG [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable Cinch Logging (clog). The Cinch logging interface provides
  methods for generating and controlling output from a running
  application.

* **CLOG_COLOR_OUTPUT [default: ON]** |br|
  Enable colorization of clog output.

* **CLOG_DEBUG [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable verbose debugging output for clog.

* **CLOG_ENABLE_EXTERNAL [default: OFF]** |br|
  The Cinch clog facility is a runtime. As such, some of the features
  provided by clog require initialization. Because of the C++ mechanism
  used by clog to implement parts of its interface, it is possible to
  call the interface from parts of the code that are *external*, i.e.,
  at file scope. Externally scoped statements are executed before the
  clog runtime can be initialized, and therefore their output cannot be
  controlled by the clog tagging feature. This option allows the user to
  enable this type of output, which can be quite verbose.

* **CLOG_ENABLE_TAGS [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable the tag feature for clog. If enabled, users can selectively
  control clog output by specifying active tags on the command line:

.. code-block:: console

  $ ./executable --tags=tag1,tag2
..

  Invoking the *--tags* flag with no arguments will list the available
  tags. **This option requries that ENABLE_BOOST_PROGRAM_OPTIONS be ON.**

* **CLOG_STRIP_LEVEL [default: 0]** |br|
  Strip levels are another mechanism to allow the user to control the
  amount of output that is generated by clog. In general, the higher the
  stip level, the fewer the number of clog messages that will be output.
  There are five strip levels in clog: *trace*, *info*, *warn*, *error*,
  and *fatal*. Output for all of these levels is turned on if the strip
  level is 0. As the strip level is increased, fewer levels are output,
  e.g., if the strip level is 3, only *error* and *fatal* log messages
  will be output. **Regardless of the strip level, clog messages that
  are designated *fatal* will generate a runtime error and will invoke
  std::exit.**

* **ENABLE_COLORING [default: OFF]** |br|
  This option controls whether or not various library dependencies and
  code sections are active that are required for graph partitioning
  (coloring) and distributed-memory parallelism. In general, if you have
  selected a runtime mode that requires this option, it will
  automatically be enabled.

* **ENABLE_COLOR_UNIT_TESTS [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable coloraization of unit test output.

* **ENABLE_COVERAGE_BUILD [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable build mode to determine the code coverage of the current set of
  unit tests. This is useful for continuous integration (CI) test analysis.

* **ENABLE_DEVEL_TARGETS [default: OFF]** |br|
  Development targets allow developers to add small programs to the
  FleCSI source code for testing code while it is being developed. These
  programs are not intended to be used as unit tests, and may be added
  or removed as the code evolves.

* **ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION [default: OFF]** |br|
  This option controls whether or not the FleCSI user and developer
  guide documentation is built. If enabled, CMake will generate these
  guides as PDFs in the *doc* subdirectory of the build.

* **ENABLE_DOXYGEN [default: OFF]** |br|
  If enabled, CMake will verify that a suitable *doxygen* binary is
  available on the system, and will add a target for generating
  Doxygen-style interface documentation from the FleCSI source code.
  **To build the doxygen documentation, users must explicitly invoke:**

.. code-block:: console

  $ make doxygen

* **ENABLE_DOXYGEN_WARN [default: OFF]** |br|
  Normal Doxygen output produces many pages worth of warnings. These are
  distracting and overly verbose. As such, they are disabled by default.
  This options allows the user to turn them back on.

* **ENABLE_EXODUS [default: OFF]** |br|
  If enabled, CMake will verify that a suitable Exodus library is
  available on the system, and will enable Exodus functionality in the
  FleCSI I/O interface.

* **ENABLE_JENKINS_OUTPUT [default: OFF]** |br|
  If this options is on, extra meta data will be output during unit test
  invocation that may be used by the Jenkins CI system.

* **ENABLE_MPI_CXX_BINDINGS [default: OFF]** |br|
  This option is a fall-back for codes that actually require the MPI C++
  bindings. **This interface is deprecated and should only be used if it
  is impossible to get rid of the dependency.**

* **ENABLE_OPENMP [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable OpenMP support. If enabled, the appropriate flags will be
  passed to the C++ compiler to enable language support for OpenMP
  pragmas.

* **ENABLE_OPENSSL [default: OFF]** |br|
  If enabled, CMake will verify that a suitable OpenSSL library is
  available on the system, and will enable the FleCSI checksum
  interface.

* **ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS [default: OFF]** |br|
  Enable FleCSI unit tests. If enabled, the unit test suite can be run
  by invoking:

.. code-block:: console

  $ make test

* **FLECSI_COUNTER_TYPE [default: int32_t]** |br|
  Specify the C++ type to use for the FleCSI counter interface.

* **FLECSI_DBC_ACTION [default: throw]** |br|
  Select the design-by-contract action.

* **FLECSI_DBC_REQUIRE [default: ON]** |br|
  Enable DBC pre/post condition assertions.

* **FLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL [default: mpi]** |br|
  Specify the low-level runtime model. Currently, *legion* and *mpi* are
  the only valid options.

* **VERSION_CREATION [default: git describe]** |br|
  This options allows the user to either directly specify a version by
  entering it here, or to let the build system provide a version using
  git describe.
