# Introduction

FleCSI is a compile-time configurable framework designed to support
multi-physics application development. As such, FleCSI provides a very
general set of infrastructure design patterns that can be specialized
and extended to suit the needs of a broad variety of solver and data
requirements. FleCSI currently supports multi-dimensional mesh topology,
geometry, and adjacency information, as well as n-dimensional
hashed-tree data structures, graph partitioning interfaces, and
dependency closures.

FleCSI introduces a functional programming model with control,
execution, and data abstractions that are consistent both with MPI and
with state-of-the-art, task-based runtimes such as Legion and Charm++.
The abstraction layer insulates developers from the underlying runtime,
while allowing support for multiple runtime systems including
conventional models like asynchronous MPI.

The intent is to provide developers with a concrete set of user-friendly
programming tools that can be used now, while allowing flexibility in
choosing runtime implementations and optimizations that can be applied
to future architectures and runtimes.

FleCSI's control and execution models provide formal nomenclature
for describing poorly understood concepts such as kernels and tasks.
FleCSI's data model provides a low-buy-in approach that makes it an
attractive option for many application projects, as developers are
not locked into particular layouts or data structure representations.

# Developers

If you are doing development of FleCSI, please take some time to read
the developer [README](developer/README.md).

# Requirements

The primary requirement for building FleCSI is that you have
a C++17-capable compiler.

## Tools

You'll need the following tools in order to build FleCSI:

   * Boost >= 1.56
   * CMake >= 3.0
   * GCC >= 7.3.0

Install tools in the customary manner for your machine, e.g. by using
*apt-get* on a Ubuntu system, or *dnf* for Fedora.

## Documentation

For documentation, you'll need these as well:

* Doxygen >= 1.8
* [cinch-utils](https://github.com/laristra/cinch-utils) >= 1.0
* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) >= 1.19

## Darwin

If you wish to build FleCSI on LANL's Darwin cluster, see the Darwin
Cluster section later in this document.

# Installing the FleCSI Third-Party Libraries

Before installing FleCSI, you should install the FleCSI third-party
libraries. We'll assume that you wish to install the FleCSI third-party
libraries in your home directory.

## Download

Begin by downloading the FleCSI third-party libraries:
```
$ cd
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/laristra/flecsi-third-party.git
```

## Build

Next, enter *flecsi-third-party* and make a build directory:
```
$ cd flecsi-third-party
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
```
Then, for example, you can do the following for a debug-mode build:
```
$ cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/flecsi-third-party-debug/
```
Alternatively, you can run *ccmake* in place of *cmake*, and use
*ccmake*'s interface to set the options.

Finally:
```
$ make
$ make install
```
builds and installs the FleCSI third-party libraries in the prefix
that you specified.

# Installing FleCSI

Now that the FleCSI third-party libraries are installed, you can
download and build FleCSI itself. As with the third-party libraries,
we'll assume that you wish to install FleCSI in your home directory.

## Download

First, download FleCSI from GitHub:
```
$ cd
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/laristra/flecsi.git
```
By default, you'll be on the *master* branch. Let's say you wish to
work in the *branchname* branch instead. Enter *flecsi*, switch to
the relevant branch, and be sure that you have the latest updates:
```
$ cd flecsi
$ git checkout branchname   # if you wish to work in this branch
$ git pull
$ git submodule update --recursive
```

## Build

You can now build FleCSI. For example, a Debug build using Legion
can be done like this:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/flecsi-third-party-debug \
    -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON \
    -DFLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL=legion
$ make
```
where *cmake*'s *-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH* should be the path that
you used for your FleCSI third-party library installation.

Again, you can run *ccmake* in place of *cmake*.

## Building the Documentation

You can build the FleCSI User and Developer Guides, as well as the
Doxygen interface documentation by specifying additional arguments to
the CMake configuration line:
```
$ cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/flecsi-third-party-debug/ \
    -DENABLE_UNIT_TESTS=ON \
    -DFLECSI_RUNTIME_MODEL=legion \
    -DENABLE_SPHINX=ON \
    -DENABLE_DOXYGEN=ON
$ make
```
This will build the User and Developer Guides in the *doc* subdirectory.

In order to build the Doxygen interface documentation, you will need to
execute:
```
$ make doxygen 
$ make sphinx
```
which will build the interface documentation (also under the *doc*
subdirectory).

## Test

From within the *build* directory, and after running *make*
as described above, you can run
```
$ make test
```
to run FleCSI's unit tests.

# Workflow

FleCSI uses the
[GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow)
workflow pattern.

When you check-out FleCSI, you'll be on the *master* branch. This is
the FleCSI development branch, which is protected in order to ensure
that it is always deployable.

New work should always be done on a separate feature branch.
When you have finished making updates to your branch, you should submit
a pull request. Your changes will be tested for compliance, and reviewed
by the maintainers of the project. If your changes are accepted, they
will be merged into *master*.

# Darwin Cluster

On Darwin, you can simplify some of the build requirements by using
the **ngc/devel-gnu** environment module:
```
$ module load ngc   # ngc/devel-gnu is the default
```
which will load up-to-date compiler and documentation tools.
It will also load a compatible Boost & MPICH libraries.

Note: Boost & MPICH modules should match the *gcc* version and gcc/8.1.0
is automatically loaded.
