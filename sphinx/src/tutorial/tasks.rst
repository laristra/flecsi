Example 2: Tasks
================

A FleCSI task is the basic execution unit of distributed-memory (SPMD)
and conventional task-based (MPMD) parallelism. This example
demonstrates defining a simple task, and registering it with the
FleCSI runtime.

A FleCSI task is a C/C++ function. Tasks that are defined in a header
file must either be inline or static. As you can see below, this
example defines a task called "simple_task", and registers it with the
runtime. The arguments to the task registration interface are:

1. The task name. This must be the actual name of the C/C++
   function. In this example, the task name is "simple_task".

2. The namespace of the task. This must be the actual namespace in
   which the task is defined. In this example, the namespace is "example".

3. The processor type on which the task should be executed.
   Currently, FleCSI has support for:

   * loc - Latency-optimized core
   * toc - Throughput-optimized core
   * mpi - An MPI task

   In this example, the processor type is "loc".

4. The launch type. This tells the runtime whether the task should
   be launched as a member of a group of executing tasks (SPMD), or
   as a single conventional task (MPMD). These launch types
   correspond to the arguments, respectively:

   * index  - Launch the task as part of a group
   * single - Launch the task as a single, independent thread of execution

   This nomenclature was adopted from the Legion programming
   system, and was originally developed by Nvidia. Future versions
   of FleCSI may add-to or change this. The most current version of
   the FleCSI interface can be found in the Doxygen and User Guide
   documentation.

   In this example, the launch type is single.

The driver in this example executes the task by invoking the execution
interface. The arguments to the execution interface are:

1. The task name. This has the same caveats of the registration
   interface. In this example, the task name is "simple_task".

2. The namespace of the task. This also has the same caveats of the
   registration interface. In this example, the namespace is
   "example".

3. The launch type. In this example, the launch type is "single".

NOTES:

* Tasks must be defined in a C++ namespace, and this namespace must
  be repeated in the registration call. This is tedious. However, it
  is a limitation of the current mechanism we have chosen to
  implement the task interface. Future versions of FleCSI will
  likely employ a DSL, which will be cleaner than the current interface.

The code for this example can be found in *tasks.cc*:

.. code-block:: cpp

  #include <iostream>

  #include<flecsi/execution/execution.h>

  namespace example {

  // This is the definition of simple_task

  void simple_task() {

    // Print message from inside of the task

    std::cout << "Hello World from " << __FUNCTION__ << std::endl;

  } // simple_task

  // This line registers the "simple_task" (defined directly above)
  // with the FleCSI runtime.
  //
  // NOTE: The task must be registered using the actual C++
  // namespace in which it is defined, i.e., "example".

  flecsi_register_task(simple_task, example, loc, single);

  } // namespace example

  namespace flecsi {
  namespace execution {

  void driver(int argc, char ** argv) {

    // This time, the driver executes a task to do the output

    flecsi_execute_task(simple_task, example, single);

  } // driver

  } // namespace execution
  } // namespace flecsi
