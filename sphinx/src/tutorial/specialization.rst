Specialization
==============

In the FleCSI nomenclature, a *specialization* is a collection of type
definitions that customize the core FleCSI topologies and data
structures to produce a domain-specific interface that is suitable for
application developers. The terminology is derived from C++, where a
specialization is simply a full or partial qualification of a
parameterized type, i.e., an `explicit
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/template_specialization>`_
or `partial
<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/partial_specialization>`_
specialization of a type.
