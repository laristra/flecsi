      Oleg is a computational physicist with a background in numerical
      relativity and relativistic astrophysics, with a particular focus
      on physics of neutron stars and accretion disks around black
      holes. He also has experience in simulating nucleosynthesis of
      heavy elements by solving complex nuclear reaction networks. He is
      interested in the inner workings of gamma-ray bursts, specifically
      in modeling violent relativistic hydrodynamics of neutron star
      mergers and investigating a variety of potentially observable
      signals.
