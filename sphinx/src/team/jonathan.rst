      Jonathan has a multidisciplinary background in observational solar
      physics, turbulence theory, astrophysical simulation, the oil and
      gas industry, and programming models for exascale computing.  He
      has published papers evaluating mesoscale ocean large-eddy
      simulation models by employing spectral transfer analysis,
      determining the limits of fractal extrapolation of the mean solar
      magnetic flux, investigating the small scale dynamo in convective,
      radiative magnetohydrodynamics, and several papers on using
      mathematical closures for large eddy simulations.

      Jonathan has been involved in using Legion task-based parallelism
      for exascale computing both in proxy applications and in the
      development of FleCSI.
