      Jonas is a computational scientist with a background in
      computational and nuclear astrophysics. His research has been
      focused on the origin of heavy elements like silver, gold, and
      uranium. He has developed a sophisticated nuclear reaction network
      to simulate how such elements and thousands of other isotopes are
      created in various astrophysical scenarios, such as the merger of
      two neutron stars or the explosion of a massive star. Jonas also
      has extensive experience with developing highly optimized code for
      GPUs. He is working on implementing physics applications on top of
      the FleCSI framework.
