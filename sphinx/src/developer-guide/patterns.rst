FleCSI Design Patterns
======================

FleCSI uses several standard C++ design patterns. If you are a FleCSI
developer (as opposed to a FleCSI user), understanding these patterns is
a first step towards understanding the design philosophy and structure
of the FleCSI core library. If you *are not* a FleCSI developer, you can
safely skip this informaiton.
